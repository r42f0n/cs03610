Section A
Answer all questions in the spaces provided.
A student has samples of three organic compounds. The samples are not labelled but are known to be propanoic acid, butanal and pentan-1-ol.
Describe three test-tube reactions that can be used to identify the three organic compounds. Use a different test-tube reaction for each compound.
Your answer should include the reagent(s) used and the expected observation for each test.

An alcohol, ROH, reacts with hydrochloric acid according to the equation
ROH + HCl → RCl + H2O
The kinetics of this reaction were investigated using this method.
• An aqueous mixture was prepared containing equal volumes of alcohol and hydrochloric acid.
• The concentration of HCl in the mixture, [HCl], was monitored by removing 5.00 cm3 samples at known times. The samples were diluted and titrated with aqueous sodium hydroxide.
• A graph was plotted of [HCl] against time.
A 5.00 cm3 sample was removed from the reaction mixture. This sample was then diluted to a volume of 25.0 cm3 using deionised water.
This diluted sample needed 11.50 cm3 of 0.255 mol dm–3 aqueous sodium hydroxide for complete neutralisation.
Calculate [HCl] in the sample removed from the reaction mixture.
Give your answer to the appropriate number of significant figures.

The kinetics of the reverse reaction (RCl + H2O → ROH + HCl) were also investigated.
The reaction was found to be first order with respect to RCl and zero order with respect to H2O
In one experiment, the results obtained were
